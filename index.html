<h1>A Glance into the Qualities of RTS Gamers</h1>
<p>Starcraft 2 is an incredibly popular real time strategy (RTS) game produced by Blizzard Entertainment. While this game is recreationally enjoyed worldwide, there also exists a well-developed ranked match system known as Battle.net that enables players to play competitively. Herein, players are divided into leagues based on their in-game performance in various match types (1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3, or 4 vs 4), such that points are won or lost according to victories or defeats, respectively. These leagues span six levels (from least points to most points): bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, and master. In addition, there exists a special level, known as grandmaster, that is reserved for the best 200 players in each region of the world. Lastly, it should be noted that there is some players play this game professionally, such that Starcraft 2 has blossomed into a electronic sport that is beloved throughout the world (in fact, Starcraft 1 was a highly successful eSport).</p>
<p>Clearly, players in each league are differentiated in terms of their different skill levels. Using data that was collected from Starcraft 2 players in order to conduct a formal cognitive science study, this blog will explore which particular statistics can serve as good indicators of league membership and, by extension, skill level. For the purposes of this analysis, all six basic leagues and the grandmaster league will be considered.</p>
<p>A reasonable statistic to begin with may be play time, after all the popular saying “practice makes perfect” does have some merit. The following figure summarizes the time commitment for players in each league. Interestingly, the amount of overall play time steadily increases as a player’s league becomes more advanced, while the per week play time only seems to noticeably increase in the very advanced leagues (master and grandmaster). </p>

<br/>

<p>Another reasonable group of statistics to assess skill level include those describe the speed with which a player issues commands and the sheer number of commands a player issues over a short time period. Respectively, this can be measured through action latency, which represents the average length between successive commands, and actions per minute, which represents the average number of commands given per minute. The following figure summarizes both of these statistics for each league. As expected, the action latency decreases and the number of actions per minute increase as a player’s league becomes more advanced.</p>

<br/>

<p>Visually, it appears that both groups of statistics shown above are associated with skill level. However, it is not evident which of these statistics is the best predictor of skill level. Consequently, a random forest will be used to fit the entire data set. By taking a consensus of many decisions trees, each of which contains a random subset of the features in the data set (which include many additional features in addition to the ones shown above), a random forest creates a robust model from which it is possible to extract the features that are most strongly associated with skill level. The same approach can be utilized using other models.Interestingly, all three models below give different importance rankings for the features. It seems, however, that action latency may be considered the best feature overall, given that it ranks most highly in all three models.</p>
