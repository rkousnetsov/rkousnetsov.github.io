While this game is recreationally enjoyed worldwide, there also exists a well-developed ranked match system known as Battle.net that enables players to play competitively. Herein, players are divided into leagues based on their in-game performance in various match types (1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3, or 4 vs 4), such that points are won or lost according to victories or defeats, respectively. These leagues span six levels (from least points to most points): bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, and master. In addition, there exists a special level, known as grandmaster, that is reserved for the best 200 players in each region of the world. Lastly, it should be noted that there is some players play this game professionally, such that Starcraft 2 has blossomed into a electronic sport that is beloved throughout the world (in fact, Starcraft 1 was a highly successful eSport).\r\n\r\n# Purpose\r\nClearly, players in each league are differentiated in terms of their different skill levels. Using data that was collected from Starcraft 2 players in order to conduct a formal cognitive science study, this blog will explore which particular statistics can serve as good indicators of league membership and, by extension, skill level. For the purposes of this analysis, all six basic leagues and the grandmaster league will be considered.\r\n\r\n# Playing Time\r\nA reasonable statistic to begin with may be play time, after all the popular saying “practice makes perfect” does have some merit. The following figure summarizes the time commitment for players in each league. Interestingly, the amount of overall play time steadily increases as a player’s league becomes more advanced, while the per week play time only seems to noticeably increase in the very advanced leagues (master and grandmaster).\r\n\r\n![Hours Per Week Playing Time By League PNG file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkousnetsov/CSCI_183/master/HW6/hoursPerWeek.png)\r\n\r\n![Total Hours Playing Time By League PNG file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkousnetsov/CSCI_183/master/HW6/totalHours.png)\r\n\r\n# Reaction Speed\r\nAnother reasonable group of statistics to assess skill level include reaction time metrics, such as the speed with which a player issues commands and the sheer number of commands a player issues over a short time period. Respectively, these statistics are represented by action latency (the average length between successive commands) and actions per minute (APM, the average number of commands given per minute). The following figure summarizes both of these statistics for each league. As expected, action latency decreases and APM increases as a player’s league becomes more advanced.\r\n\r\n![Hours Per Week Playing Time By League PNG file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkousnetsov/CSCI_183/master/HW6/apm.png)\r\n\r\n![Total Hours Playing Time By League PNG file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkousnetsov/CSCI_183/master/HW6/actionLatency.png)\r\n\r\n# Cognitive Features\r\nWhile APM may be appear to be a good feature for distinguishing players by league, it is evident that players can artificially inflate their number of actions per minute (and thereby lower the action latency) by spamming repetitive actions of little value (in fact, many players like to “warm up” their hands by rapidly hitting keys). It is possible to correct for this phenomenon using a modified measure known as effective actions per minute (EPM), but the authors instead chose a different statistic that they call a perception-action-cycle (PAC), which, in terms of cognition, encompasses the act of perception and then acting upon that newly perceived information. In terms of the actual game, this often signifies a movement of the camera followed by an action. This statistic, therefore, provides a better measure of tactically meaningful actions. The two box plots below demonstrate the rate of and gap between players’ PACs. Note that these plots are respectively similar in their shape to APM and action latency. Ultimately, these PAC statistics are robust features for distinguishing league with the added benefit of being resistant to ineffective actions.\r\n\r\n![Rate of PACs By League PNG file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkousnetsov/CSCI_183/master/HW6/ratePACs.png)\r\n\r\n![Gap between PACs By League PNG file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkousnetsov/CSCI_183/master/HW6/gapPACs.png)\r\n\r\n# Comparing features\r\nVisually, it appears that both groups of statistics shown above are associated with skill level. However, it is not evident which of these statistics is the best predictor of skill level. Consequently, a random forest will be used to fit the entire data set. By taking a consensus of many decisions trees, each of which contains a random subset of the features in the data set (which include many additional features in addition to the ones shown above), a random forest creates a robust model from which it is possible to extract the features that are most strongly associated with skill level. The same approach can be utilized using other models (for now, this will include extremely randomized trees and gradient boosting). Interestingly, all three models below give different importance rankings for the features. It seems, however, that action latency may be considered the best feature overall, given that it ranks most highly in all three models.\r\n\r\nRandom Forest | Extremely Randomized Trees | Gradient Boosting\r\n------------- | -------------------------- | -----------------\r\nAction Latency | Action Latency | Gap between PACs\r\nAPM | APM | Action Latency\r\nNumber of PACs | Number of PACs | Number of PACs\r\nSelection by Hotkeys | Gap between PACs | Workers Made\r\nTotal Hours Played | Total Hours Played | Assignment to Hotkeys\r\nGap between PACs | Assignment to Hotkeys | Selection by Hotkeys\r\nAssignment to Hotkeys | Selection by Hotkeys | APM\r\nWorkers Made | Minimap Attacks | Number of actions in PAC\r\nMinimap Attacks | Workers Made | Minimap right clicks\r\nNumber of actions in PAC | Number of unique hotkeys | Total Hours Played\r\nMinimap right clicks | Hours per week play time | Minimap Attacks\r\nPercentage of map explored | Number of actions in PAC | Percentage of map explored\r\nPlayer age | Player age | Complex Ability Usage\r\nHours per week play time | Percentage of map explored | Hours per week play time\r\nNumber of unique hotkeys | Minimap right clicks | Complex Units Made\r\nComplex Ability Usage | Unique Units Made | Player age\r\nUnique Units Made | Complex Ability Usage | Number of unique hotkeys\r\nComplex Units Made | Complex Units Made | Unique Units Made\r\n\r\n# Final Remarks\r\nThese statistics support the notion that the best measures of skill level (league membership) are based on how quickly a player can make actions. This makes sense, given that a player that can perform the most actions often has the best micromanagement (control of individual units in a strategic and skillful manner) and macromanagement (establishment of a stable resource economy for the production of units).\r\n\r\n# Useful Links\r\n[Starcraft 2 Official Website](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/)\r\n\r\n[Starcraft 2 Wiki](http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/StarCraft_II)\r\n\r\n[Website containing data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SkillCraft1+Master+Table+Dataset)\r\n\r\n[Website containing journal article that used this data set](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075129)\r\n\r\n[Website containing elegant, dynamic visualization of data using the Tableau Framework](http://sc2skillviz.appspot.com/)\r\n\r\n[My GitHub page containing all code and images used in this blog](https://github.com/rkousnetsov/CSCI_183/tree/master/HW6)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
